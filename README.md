Small demo I made. consists of a population of creatures that eat food pellets to reproduce and create slight variations in their stats when they do so.
It has a weird issue where the creatures seem to gravitate towards the bottom and occasionally turn away from food pellets. I have no idea how to fix these, so they're features now.
